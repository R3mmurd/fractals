# Fractal geometry in Python

This repository contains codes that I wrote by following the course
[Fractal Geometry in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/fractal-geometry-in-python/)
through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/).

The content of each of the programs is described below:

`cantor_set.py`: Contains the implementation of a program that draws a
[Cantor Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set).

`turtle_graphics.py`: Contains a program that shows how to use the module
[turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to draw circles.

`hexagonal_spiral.py`: Contains a program that shows how to use the module
[turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to draw hexagonal spirals.

`algae_growth.py`: Contains the implementation of an [L-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)
that represents the algae growth.

`fractal.py`: Contains some functions to generate
[fractals](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) as
[L-systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) and
drawing them with the module [turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).

`Koch_curve.py`: Contains a program that draws a [Koch curve](https://larryriddle.agnesscott.org/ifs/kcurve/kcurve.htm).

`Koch_snowflake.py`: Contains a program that draws a [Koch snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake).

`dragon_curve.py`: Contains a program that draws a basic [dragon curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve).

`jp_dragon.py`: Contains a program that draws a
[Jurassic Park dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve#Heighway_dragon).

`Sierpinski_triangle.py`: Contains a program that draws a
[Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).

`weed.py`: Contains a program that draws a weed growing.

`tree.py`: Contains a program that draws a tree growing.

`Hilbert.py`: contains a program that draws a
[Hilbert space-filling curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve).

`Sierpinski_arrowhead.py`: Contains a program that draws a
[Sierpinski arrowhead](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SierpinskiArrowheadCurve.html).

`cellular_automaton.py`: Contains the implementation of a
[cellular automaton](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html)
that generates a [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle).

`rule30.py`: Contains a program with the implementation of
[rule 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30).

`game_of_life.py`: Contains a program with the implementation of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

`majority_rule.py`: Contains a program with the implementation of
[majority rule cellular automaton](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~adomaiti/ench250/cachapter.pdf).
